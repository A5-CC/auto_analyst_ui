Always use "@" alias imports when importing from the components directory or other configured path aliases.

Rules:
1) Use "@/components/..." instead of relative paths like "./components/..." or "../components/..."
2) Use "@/lib/..." instead of relative paths to lib directory
3) Use "@/utils/..." instead of relative paths to utils directory
4) Only use relative imports for files within the same immediate directory (e.g., "./types" from within the same folder)
5) This makes imports cleaner, more consistent, and easier to refactor

Examples:
✅ Good:
```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { DashboardHeader } from "@/components/analytics/dashboard-header"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
```

❌ Bad:
```tsx
import { Button } from "../ui/button"
import { DashboardHeader } from "./analytics/dashboard-header"
import { cn } from "../../lib/utils"
```
