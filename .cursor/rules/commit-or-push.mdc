User will instruct to commit or commit+push changes you have done.

For that:

1) Use git status + any other git command needed to get a sense/recap of the current changes. Use cmd tool.
2) Add the relevant files with git add etc.
3) Commit with a proper commit message (take a look at previous commit messages with cmd tool to get a sense of the commit msgs style, tone and voice)
4) If the instruction was to commit, it's done. If the instruction was tu push, then push.
